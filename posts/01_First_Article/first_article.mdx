Two years ago, I moved to Paris studying at the Gobelins school. Overall, it's a very engaging learning experience and I'm grateful of being here.

If I could travel back in time, this is what I would have whispered to myself

- love what you do, no matter what other people say.
- But I mean, you really shouldn't care about other peoples opinion.
- You hear me ? Trust yourself and do your thing.
- Only work with people you can trust.
- Trust the people you work with.
- Love what you do. Do your thing. Have fun doing it. Work for it every day.

The best advice I can give is to believe in yourself and surround yourself with people you truly love (and who love you too) :)  

Take care,
Life is precious.
