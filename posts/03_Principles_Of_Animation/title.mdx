  The 12 principles of animation were developed by Frank Thomas and Ollie
  Johnstonof at Walt Disney Studios, during the 1930s. 
  
  These principles came as
  a result of reflection about their practice and through Disney's desire to use
  animation to express character and personality. These principles form the
  basis of all animation work.
