I love animation. I remember when I was a kid, going at Disney Studio and watching some badass animators drawing Mushu (the dragon of Mulan) on a paper board. It was just amazing to see how fluent the dragon took life, frame by frame, through animation. The animators added so much personality to Mushu by adding all the little details.

It became kind of an obsession for me to watch movies, and to see all the beautiful and hard work. I love deconstructing master pieces, by taking screenshots and saving them for later.

So yep, thatâ€™s it. My goal is to (help) understand the role of animation on digital interfaces and how we perceive animation through our emotions.

Psst.. there are going to be a lot of gifs ðŸ¤“

Ready ?
