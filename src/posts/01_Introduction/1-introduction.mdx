- [to use animation for problem solving ]()    
- [to use animation for the power of good]()    
- [to find a place for animation in a design process]()    
- [to animate responsibly in order to avoid sickness and vestibular disorders]()    
- [to give more personality and joy to digital interfaces]()   
- [to use interactive animation to tell a story]()
