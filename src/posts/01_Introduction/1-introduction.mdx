This is the interactive guidebook for a study on animation I work on for school (and myself, because it's very interesting).

- This book guides us:   
- [to use animation for problem solving ](./improving-the-ux-through-animation/using-animation-to-solve-design-problems)    
- [to use animation for the power of good](./improving-the-ux-through-animation/how-to-use-animation-for-the-power-of-good)    
- [to find a place for animation in a design process](./improving-the-ux-through-animation/how-to-find-a-place-for-animation-in-a-design-process)    
- [to animate responsibly in order to avoid sickness and vestibular disorders](./improving-the-ux-through-animation/animation-and-accessibility)    
- [to give more personality and joy to digital interfaces](./12-principles-of-animation/squash-&-stretch)   
- [to use interactive animation to tell a story](./a-brief-history-of-motion-design/index)
