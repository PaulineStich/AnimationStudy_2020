#### Cave drawings

Caves drawings are spectacular 🐆
But more than that, cave paintings are a testimony from our ancestors on what the world looked like 100.000 years ago. We can already see the interpolation of movements, where we can find the very first ideas of animation.

#### The baroque era

We're in Germany in the XVII century and new tools came such as the Magic Lantern. The Magic Lantern projects light through a transparent plate, showing a static image. It's the first time people can see real images trough camera obscura. It is mainly designed to entertain the public.  

Some other tools are emerging, such as the phenakistoscope. By rotating it, we can see an animation appearing. This phenomenon is called retinal persistence.

Retinal persistence lets us store a visual impression in memory for a few hundred milliseconds after the visual stimulus has disappeared. By projecting rapidly images one after another, our brain fills in the dark holes. This creates the illusion of fluid animation and now we can view a film 📽️ .

#### Hand by hand animation

In the XVIII century, the real revolution came and hand drawn frame-by-frame became popular.

- 📽️  ["fantasmogorie" Emile Cohl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1d28X0lkJ4) (1908)

One of these movements focused more on sound and color, and how they could be perceived together called "synesthesia". Innovative creations came such as the "Color Organ" from Bainbridge Bishops (1877), the Wallace Remington's "Clavier of Lumière" (1893) and Thomas Wilfred's "Lumia" (1920s)

#### Absolute film

A new movement was born, called "absolute film". Light and composition are used together to create emotional responses through melody and musical rythm.

1. Oskar Fischinger(1900 - 1967)
2. Walter Ruttmann (1877-1941)

Absolute film used painting on glass, wax, drawings, clay, projectors and some other techniques I can't even understand. An excellent example of not being limited by the tools of your era. Even more important, not expecting there is a right tool.

Why it's so innovating ? Because they used for the first time melody together with motion, and animation makes so much more sense with the right sound.

#### Conclusion

Motion Design is a tool/or technique that uses graphics and puts them in movement, almost and always paired with audio and for a specific purpose.

- 🌿 informative (explain an object, place, etc)
- 🌿 storytelling (explain a story)
- 🌿 abstract (like absolute film, it's a type of animation that is used to be more artistic in order to create emotional responses)
