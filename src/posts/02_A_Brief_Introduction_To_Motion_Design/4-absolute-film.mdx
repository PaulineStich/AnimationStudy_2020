A new movement was born, called "absolute film". Light and composition are used together to create emotional responses through melody and musical rythm.

1. Oskar Fischinger(1900 - 1967)
2. Walter Ruttmann (1877-1941)

Absolute film used painting on glass, wax, drawings, clay, projectors and some other techniques I can't even understand. An excellent example of not being limited by the tools of your era. Even more important, not expecting there is a right tool.

Why it's so innovating ? Because they used for the first time melody together with motion, and animation makes so much more sense with the right sound.
