When applied, it gives your animated characters and objects the illusion of gravity, weight, mass and flexibility.

<Hint>
  Think about how a bouncing rubber ball may react when tossed into the air: the
  ball stretches when it travels up and down and squishes when it hits the
  ground. When using squash and stretch, it's important to keep the object's
  volume consistent. So when you stretch something it needs to get thinner, and
  when you squash something it needs to get wider.
