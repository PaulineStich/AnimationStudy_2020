![pose to pose](/gif/poseToPose.gif)

Straight ahead action involves drawing frame-by-frame from start to finish.
With the pose to pose technique, you draw the beginning frame, the end frame,
and a few key frames in-between. Then you go back and complete the rest. This
technique gives you a bit more control within the scene and allows you to
increase the **dramatic** effect of the motion.
