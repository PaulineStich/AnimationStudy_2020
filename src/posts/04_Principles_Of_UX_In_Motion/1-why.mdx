<SlideTemplate title="Why do the 12 basic principles of animation don't describe UI animation?">

UI animation, as part of the user experience is barely 20 years old (video games and GUI are older and so, are animated earlier than UI). The only tools available to describe how the user interface behaves in time were the 12 animation principles.

UI animation do not obey the same rules nor have the same principles as organic bodies moving in physical space. This is the reason why this subject if so discussed. 


##### Realtime vs non-realtime interactions

Realtime means that the user is directly interacting with the objects in the user interface.
Non-realtime means that the object behavior is post-interactive: it occurs after a user action, and is transitional.


##### Motion supports usability

Expectation: we want to minimize the gap between what the user expects, and what they experience.
Continuity: the continuity is what makes up the total user experience.
Narrative: narrative is the linear progression of events in the user experience
Relationship: relationship refers to the spatial, temporal, and hierarchal representations between interface objects that guide user understanding and decision making.

<Hint>
  Disney's principles are interesting and useful to understand motion in space, but do not fully apply to UI animation simply because because UI animation is solving a different problem.
