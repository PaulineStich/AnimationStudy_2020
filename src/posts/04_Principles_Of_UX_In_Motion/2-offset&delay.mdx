![offset & delay](/gif/ux_overlap.gif)

**Disney**: ‘Follow Through and Overlapping Action.’  
**Ux**: Relationship  
**Why** ? When the designer is using time itself to say (even before the user registers what the objects are) that the objects are separate, it has the effect of telling the user: "this is completely independent from the rest of the visual design, you can use it in the interface".  
**To summarize**: Use offsets in temporal behavior **to explain visually what your interface is capable of**.
