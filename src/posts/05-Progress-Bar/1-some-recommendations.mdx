    introduction="Users do have high expectations on digital interfaces. This is especially true with a huge variate of excellent iOS apps, macOS tools, and well-crafted websites. People have a certain quality bar. By default, users expect a fast reaction from the digital products they’re working with."

#### Why should the user wait after all?

In real-world situations, you can face slow internet connection, not optimized code, long operation processing or just too much data. So the app might work not as fast as the users expect it.
While early adopters can give our product a second chance, the vast majority of people will close it right away.
Unless the interface of our product provides clear immediate feedback on users’ action.
What has just happened — a bug or a simple request to the server?
How much time does the user need to wait for using the tool or a website? And why should the user wait at all?

- 🌿reassure the user that the system has not crashed but is working  
- 🌿 indicate approximately how long the user can be expected to wait  
- 🌿 finally provide something for the user to look at  

#### Some recommendations

In cases where the computer cannot provide fairly immediate response, continuous feedback should be provided to the user in form of a percent-done indicator

- 🌿 Explain why the user needs to wait.

#### Don’t do this

- ⚠️ Showing the **same loading indicator** an infinite amount of times  

→ *will annoy users*

- ⚠️ **not showing any time indication** when loading time is known, is definitely a bad idea  

→ *It can be a simple message or the approximate time left to wait*
