<SlideTemplate title="Some recommendations">


- reassure the user that the system has not crashed but is working
- indicate approximately how long the user can be expected to wait
- finally provide something for the user to look at


##### Some recommendations  

🍏  In cases where the computer cannot provide fairly immediate response, continuous feedback should be provided to the user in form of a percent-done indicator

🍏  Explain why the user needs to wait.


##### Don’t do this  

🍎 Showing the same loading indicator an infinite amount of times 
→ will annoy users. 

🍎 not showing any time indication when loading time is known, is definitely a bad idea
→ It can be a simple message or the approximate time left to wait
