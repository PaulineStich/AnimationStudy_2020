<SlideTemplate title="What about Skeleton screens?">

Skeleton screens provide incremental progress in loading the interface. You can imagine them as blank pages (placeholders) with step-by-step loading of images, text and other content you might see on the page.  

This term firstly appeared in the Luke Wroblewski article, mentioned already [Mobile Design Details: Avoid The Spinner, 2013](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1797). 
Luke advised using skeleton screens for a better loading experience. This idea was supported by other designers in the space and used in the UI of Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Google Drive & others.
