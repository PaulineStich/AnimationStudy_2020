#### Have a Known Purpose 

The very first rule of interface animation is that all interface animations must have a purpose for being there.

- 💡 what’s the purpose of the animation ? Do you think it has a reason for being there?  

#### Don’t Create Obstacles

Of course, you would never intentionally make it more difficult for your users to complete a given task, but it’s easy to get carried away while designing something beautiful. If at any time your user finds herself waiting unnecessarily for an animation to finish before she can make her next move, there’s a problem.

- ⚠️ your user doesn’t have to wait for an animation to finish before she can make her next move


#### Avoid Animation That Becomes an Obstacle

Accessing the main navigation should be quick and easy.

- ⚠️ don’t add transition that adds time to something that will be accessed often


#### Fast, nonblocking feedback

Good interface animations need to be **flexible** and **always feel responsive** to a user’s input even if the animation is currently animating. 

- 🌿 Your animation should **responds to input** even while it’s actively animating


#### Be Quick, Be Readable: Timing

Good timing is more an art than a science.

- 🌿 Interface animations should be as **fast** as they can be while still being **readable**.

small elements: in between 250ms to 350ms
larger motion: in between 400ms to 500ms

- 🌿 The only way to **judge the timing** is to **try the animation** out for yourself. Or even better, have others try it, too.


#### The more you do it, the better you’ll be at it.

- 💪 Just get better at it by doing more.
