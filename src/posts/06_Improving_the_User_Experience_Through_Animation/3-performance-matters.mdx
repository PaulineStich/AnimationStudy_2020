On the web, performance is **hugely important**.
We can use CSS animations and transitions to add just a dash of interface animation to our work, or go all out with WebGL to create a full 3D experience, all within our browser. Having this huge range of options is wonderful.

- ðŸŒ¿ Use **css** properties for animating simple things such as **opacity, scale, rotation,** and **position** (when done with transforms).
- ðŸŒ¿ As your animations grow in **complexity** and the need for deeper logic, move to **JavaScript** solutions that can accomplish what you need.
- ðŸŒ¿ Always keep an eye on **how much you are loading** in versus **what youâ€™re actually using**.
