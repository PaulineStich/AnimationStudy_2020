<SlideTemplate title="Performance Matters">

On the web, performance is **hugely important**.
We can use CSS animations and transitions to add just a dash of interface animation to our work, or go all out with WebGL to create a full 3D experience, all within our browser. Having this huge range of options is wonderful.

- use css properties for animating simple things such as opacity, scale, rotation, and position (when done with transforms).  
- As your animations grow in complexity and the need for deeper logic, move to JavaScript solutions that can accomplish what you need.  
- Always keep an eye on how much you are loading in versus what you’re actually using.

<Hint>
  Animation alone can’t make your interface faster, but it can help create the perception that things are happening faster.
