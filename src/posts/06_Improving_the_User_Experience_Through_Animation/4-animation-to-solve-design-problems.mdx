    introduction="Like the concept of invisible design, invisible interface animations are so well done, so seamlessly part of the interaction, that you donâ€™t even notice that youâ€™re looking at animation. On the other hand, a beautifully executed animation that has no functional reason for being there will undermine its beauty by being annoying and distracting. And this is causing a lot of problems."

#### So to be useful and to solve design problems, animation can:

The very first rule of interface animation is that all interface animations must have **a purpose for being there**.

- ðŸ’¡ Animation helps users create a mental model of the interface, even the parts that arenâ€™t currently in view. 
- ðŸŒ¿ **Move between layers** of a layered interface (just like in the physical world, you can animate layer to create a **shared understanding of space**).
- ðŸŒ¿ **Guide users** through the steps **to complete a task**. 

#### Using Animation to Direct Focus and Attention

Animation is incredibly useful for attracting attention. In fact, thatâ€™s a big part of why itâ€™s used so much in annoying banner ads (banners are a big part of why animation on the web has a bad reputation).

- âœ¨A high contrast example of using animation to focus usersâ€™ attention on something thatâ€™s important to them is CodePenâ€™s save button. New Pens need to be saved periodically while youâ€™re working on them, so you donâ€™t lose your work. To remind users of that, the save button **starts pulsing** after a minute or so of not saving your work. 

#### Think Eye Flow

A logical flow of motion can influence your userâ€™s gaze invisibly and make following the flow of information feel almost effortless. On the other hand, motion that seems to come and go from all directions causes tension and confusion.

- âœ¨[When moving directionally in and out of the modal window in Pinterest](https://vimeo.com/162719984), animations are based **on their position in the grid.**

#### Have fun

Using the attention grabbing power of animation for good can also mean having a little fun with it, too.

- âœ¨I doubt that anyone using the Zappos app was expecting a [cape-clad cat](https://vimeo.com/162721302) to appear anywhere. The animation calls attention to the important action of adding an item to your cart and celebrates the moment

![readme](/gif/readme_owl.gif)
- âœ¨In Readme, [an owl](https://dash.readme.io/login) covers her eyes while you type in your password. This type of animation responds when the user is typing sensitive information, making the interaction feeling important. By creating fun you can build memorable experiences for the users.  

![yeti](/gif/codepen_yeti.gif)
- âœ¨Thereâ€™s also [this yeti](https://codepen.io/dsenneff/pen/2c3e5bc86b372d5424b00edaf4990173) on codepen.

#### You can use animationâ€™s attention grabbing powers for good by

- ðŸŒ¿ **Animate the most important content** for your users. 
- ðŸŒ¿ **Direct eye flow** and **guide** your users **through the content hierarchy** with motion.
- ðŸŒ¿ Using **visual continuity** to show **when an object hasnâ€™t changed**. 
- ðŸŒ¿ **Work with a defined easing palette** and create **contrast**.
