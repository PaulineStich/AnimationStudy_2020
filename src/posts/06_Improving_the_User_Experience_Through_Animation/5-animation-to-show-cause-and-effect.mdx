#### Using animation to reveal options as they’re needed can work to cue users based on their recent actions.

- ✨[Dropbox Paper’s use of animation](https://vimeo.com/162721550) for this menu is the most energetic and the most pronounced.
The resulting animation reads as energetic with a touch of playfulness.

#### Onboarding process

- 🌿When someone is completely new to your app, they could use a little help discovering how to use your app’s interface.

- ✨On Slack [there’s a subtle pulsing icon appearing around the menu](https://vimeo.com/162721537), one at a time. Clicking on the icon reveals details about how that feature can be used. It can be ignored.

#### Confirm an Action’s Effect

By explicitly showing what has changed, your user can feel more informed about what has happened. 

- Previewing the effect of an action before it’s taken. 
- Confirming an action’s effect once it has been taken.

#### Using Animation for Feedback

Giving good feedback is imperative for good interface design. 

- 🌿 **When something is happening behind the scenes**, whether it’s fetching data or completing a request, **it’s important to show that something is happening**

#### Animate Effective Error Messages

- ✨In Stripe Checkout, the shaking animation is paired with a red outline around the problematic fields to indicate where the error is. 

It gives  a common real-world motion of someone shaking his or her head “no.”

#### Loader Animations That Convey Progress

- 🌿 The more **real feedback** you can give, the more satisfactory the loading experience will be for all involved.
