#### Loader Animations That Convey Progress

- 🌿 The more **real feedback** you can give, the more satisfactory the loading experience will be for all involved.

#### No generic spinners

Viget have done a small study on loaders and came to some interesting conclusions. Their small experiment found that participants were more willing to wait for custom loading animations than generic loading animations.

When you really don’t know how long a loading operation will take while things are happening in the background, and there is no additional or incremental feedback available to share, in those cases creating a custom loading animation (instead of opting for a generic loading bar or spinner) can improve the experience.

#### Skeleton screens

[“The Psychology of Waiting, Loading Animations, and Facebook,”](https://mercury.io/blog/the-psychology-of-waiting-loading-animations-and-facebook) Rusty Mitchell suggests, based on findings from Facebook’s research, that when load times are very long, generic spinners cause users to blame their device for the slowness, not the app that is being slow. Instances where additional information needs to be fetched from the server, are perfect opportunities to use animation to fill that time in a meaningful and useful way.

**Showing skeleton content while content is being loaded can make it seem like things are loading faster.** A study from the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland4 found that showing a hint of content was perceived as faster by users when compared with a loading spinner animation.
Study indicate that **the sooner you show some hint of the new content, the faster the load time is perceived to be**.
