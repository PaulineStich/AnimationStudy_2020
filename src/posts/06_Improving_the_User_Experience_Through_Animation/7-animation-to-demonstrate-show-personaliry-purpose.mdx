#### Some tips

- 🌿 Avoid **any build animations are more than 5 seconds long**, unless it's very clear on what's happening under the hood
- 🌿 Focus on having **one clear short message**
- 🌿 Have **the end state** of the build-in animation **be usable** items of the interface.
- 🌿 **Avoid introducing extra elements just for show**. Make the “intro” a part of the interface as much as possible.
- 🌿 If **the motion** is **large** or **drastic**, consider giving users an option to **reduce** it or **turn it off**.
