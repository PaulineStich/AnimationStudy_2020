[“The Psychology of Waiting, Loading Animations, and Facebook,”](https://mercury.io/blog/the-psychology-of-waiting-loading-animations-and-facebook) Rusty Mitchell suggests, based on findings from Facebook’s research, that when load times are very long, generic spinners cause users to blame their device for the slowness, not the app that is being slow.

Instances where additional information needs to be fetched from the server, are perfect opportunities to use animation to fill that time in a meaningful and useful way.

Showing skeleton content while content is being loaded can make it seem like things are loading faster. A study from the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland4 found that showing a hint of content was perceived as faster by users when compared with a loading spinner animation.

Study indicate that the sooner you show some hint of the new content, the faster the load time is perceived to be (example: skeleton screens).

- the sooner you can, show some hint of the new content

Whether the behind-the-scenes progress is known or unknown, loading time gives you an opportunity to show that you care about your users when you design the animation well.
