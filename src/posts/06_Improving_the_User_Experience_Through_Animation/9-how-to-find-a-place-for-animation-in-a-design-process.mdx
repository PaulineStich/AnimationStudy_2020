  introduction="So often, animation doesnâ€™t get much thought or attention until the very end of a project. Finally, all the hard parts of the design have been figured out, so itâ€™s finally time to think about the fun details. But by that point, itâ€™s often too late. Timelines and budgets are pushing their limits. By leaving it to the end, youâ€™re treating animation like the icing on the cake. In order to get those benefits, however, animation has to be part of the whole cake, not just the icingâ€”it needs to be a part of your entire process all along the way."

#### Discussing with your team to identify where animation could be the most helpful

Usually, one of the early steps involves **discussing the main tasks** the app or site is meant to do, or the expected user flows through it. 

- ðŸ’¡**Where** could it play a helpful role in improving the user experience?
- ðŸ’¡**What's the most important interaction** of your site or app? The one thing that offers the most value to your users?

Your main focus should be on **finding the places where purposeful animation will improve the experience and define exactly what the purpose is of each animation**. No UI animation should make it to the final product without knowing its **purpose**.

#### Sketching and storyboarding animation ideas 

Storyboards are best at answering questions like: 

- ðŸ’¡Would animation be **helpful** here?

#### Create Animation Prototypes 

Youâ€™ve identified where animation could be useful but you still need to determine the look and feel of that animation.
**The main question that animation prototypes help answer is**: 

- ðŸ’¡How will this **behave**?

Tools like Keynote, After Effects, Animate, Framer, etc.. (Creating prototypes should be as quick and easy as possible)

#### Add animation in your style guide

Style guides or design guideline documents are a great place to **document your animation design decisions.**   

1. If itâ€™s primarily aimed at **developers**, code samples and best practices for coding animation would be helpful to include.

2. If the main audience is **marketing** or a PR staff without a strong design background, the focus would need to be on the design **reasoning behind the animation** and being **clear on which elements may or may not be animated**.

#### Document animation:  
â†’ **purpose**   
1. Entrances and exits  
2. Causality   
3. Emphasis  
4. Feedback  
5. Transitions between states  
6. Orientation  
7. Personality and branding  
8. Storytelling   

â†’ **properties**  
1. Opacity     
2. Scale   
3. Color   
4. Depth  
5. Position  
6. Rotation  
7. Blur   

If you have layers in your interface, your documentation should include a diagram of which depths are used for what. 

#### Reusable components

Reusable components are used in a design system, and itâ€™s no different with animation.   

Keep in mind sometimes, even with beautiful animation and a design system, some animations donâ€™t work so well together.

#### Get real feedback

- ðŸ’¡ Does the Animation **Feel Right**? Is It **Usable**?

The key factor Iâ€™ve noticed in every team Iâ€™ve spoken to that does animation well is **communication** (they are also using tools who help improve communication between their designers and developers).  

Regardless of how or how many prototypes they make, theyâ€™re communicating about **both the design and technical goals** of what theyâ€™re working on and how animation fits into those goals.
