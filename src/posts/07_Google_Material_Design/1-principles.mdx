At Google Material Design, there are three principles for effective motion design.


- Informative

Motion shows hierarchical relationships between elements, which actions are available, and what will happen if an action is taken.


- Focused

Motion focuses attention on what's important without creating unnecessary distraction.


- Expressive

Motion expresses a brandâ€™s personality and style.
