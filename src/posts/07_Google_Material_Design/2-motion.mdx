#### Motion is feeling energy

In the Material Design Guidelines, motion plays an integral part to the overall feeling and functionality of the design framework. It conveys **energy**, drawing inspiration from forces like gravity and friction. Material motion responds to the user’s input, just like in real world interaction. 

#### Motion aims to feel natural.
