#### Problem: The page is boring.

The first reason that comes in mind, is **the lack of interesting content**.
When the logic and the content is good, there are also such big factors as **emotional** and **aesthetic satisfaction** able to influence user experience greatly.  

To improve a page and make it more user-friendly, you can work on:

- ðŸŒ¿**interesting content **
- ðŸŒ¿**colors, gradients** (and make them transition)
- ðŸŒ¿make movements dynamic or smooth (the so called "natural feeling" )
- ðŸŒ¿strengthen the power of **UI elements with motion** and **original transitions**

#### Problem: I want the interaction to feel natural.

Start by learning **the basics**  

â†’ [see article "12 principles of animation" by Disney](https://www.animationhe.ro/12-principles-of-animation)  
It helps **understand natural interaction** with **physical objects**.  
â†’ [see article "12 principles of UX in motion"](https://www.animationhe.ro/12-principles-of-ux-in-motion)  
It helps **understand basic animation principles** like **easing**, **transitions**, ..  

#### Problem: I want to see the key things first.  
Usersâ€™ attention should be immediately drawn to **the key element of interaction**, through **visual hierarchy** and **clear navigation**.

#### Problem: The waiting time for the loader is too long.
The best progress bar is no progress bar. If possible, choose skeleton screens (the sooner you can, show some hint of the new content).   

â†’ see articles on "[Progress indicators: a useful guide](https://www.animationhe.ro/progress-indicators)"   
â†’ see article on "[Using Animation to Show Cause and Effect](https://www.animationhe.ro/improving-the-ux-through-animation/using-animation-to-show-cause-and-effect) Â»  

**Loading time** gives you an opportunity **to show that you care about your users**.
